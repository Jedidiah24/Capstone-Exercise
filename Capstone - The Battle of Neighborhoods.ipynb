This is to particularly assist a businessperson who is interested in opening a Japanese restaurant in Toronto, Ontario. Meanwhile there are a lot of restaurants in Toronto. We will try to identify locations with less or no restaurants, especially neighbourhoods with no Japanese restaurants.\n\nUsing data science approaches, we will generate a few most likely neighbourhoods, clearly expressing advantages of each area in order that the businessperson can choose the best possible location.\n"
